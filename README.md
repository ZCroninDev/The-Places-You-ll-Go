# The-Places-You-ll-Go-
A personal collection of travel destiniations. 

## Description

As a kid I had big dreams of going to exotic places and having amazing experiences! Although I have been fortunate enough to have some of these experiences, life had other plans for me. I have not let my dreams diminish, they have merely been delayed. I work hard everyday to become a better developer and towards achieving financial freedom. One day I will climb the highest of mountains, walk the paths seldom traveled, and see the world in ways I never would have imagined possible.
